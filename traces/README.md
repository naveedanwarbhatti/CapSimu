The RF traces are taken form [MSPSim](https://github.com/ransford/mspsim/tree/mementos/traces).

Each line in each trace looks like this: \<time\> \<voltage\>

The \<time\> field starts at an arbitrary number and counts milliseconds.  The \<voltage\> field is just voltage in volts.

The device being tested was as follows: the analog front-end from an Intel DL WISP 4.1 connected to a 30 kohm resistor instead of the WISP's digital back-end.
